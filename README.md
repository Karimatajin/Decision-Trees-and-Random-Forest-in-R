# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests-in-R

## Task

Trying to predict the price of the houses using Regression Tree and Random Forest

## Objective of Regression Tree and Random Forest

Regression Trees try to predict a (numeric) mean response at the leaves of the tree, such as the expected amount of rain in inches, or the expected default rate on loans.

Random forests are a strong modeling technique and much more robust than a single decision tree. They aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well as error due to bias and therefore yield useful results.

## Steps of Regression Trees

1- Select the target variable by using glimpse function

2- Fit a model that can predict the target variable using the predictors variables

3- Make a few predictions with the predict() function 

4- plot the regression tree using rpart.plot library
